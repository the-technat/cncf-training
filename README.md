# cncf-training

Resources related to my CKS,CKA,CKAD training. Will be used whenever I have to renew one of these certifications.

## CKS

### Lab Env

See [lab_env](./00_lab_env) for how to setup. It's probably outdated and needs an update.

### Awesome CKS Software

Probably already known but here again, a [Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).

For an up-to-date list see the [Awesome CKS Tools list](https://github.com/stars/the-technat/lists/awesome-cks-tools).

### Fazit of the CKS

> Docker and Kubernetes massively transformed the way how software is packaged, shipped and run. But with one major drawback: They ignored security completely in order to gain speed and become adopted faster. So the biggest challenge in containeraized environments today, is to make them secure. By secure I don't mean any rocket sience that no one understands, just follow [some basic best-practices](https://sysdig.com/blog/dockerfile-best-practices/) when packaging container images and most of the work is done.
